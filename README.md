- 🔭 I’m currently working on [The_best_offense](https://samiyazaki.github.io/The_best_offense)<img src="Assets\Password Generator example.gif" alt="image of site deployed" /> </a>

## This is a project that is intended to be a collection of all of my work and projects going forward in my career as a developer. Please check out what I have working and give it a try.
## As you can see there is a navigation page on the left hand side of the screen that will allow you to skip to the About, Projects and Contact sections of the site.
## On the right you can see links to my Github and LinkedIn accounts. The buttons glow by rotating through 360 degrees of the color wheel.
## The about me section includes a picture of me in my boat shirt, in front of a boat painting, with boats in bottles at a maritime museum. I like the ocean in case you couldn't tell.
## My projects are primarily from before my foray into software development, the first is a website and series of product photoshoots I did for a client, followed by a website I designed for a client and commisioned as well as a site I built myself in WordPress. The next two are from my bootcamp, and finally a small javaScript game that I built with my son.
## The final section is a contact section which is currently non-functional but the phone call button works as well as a little easter egg with the other button.
